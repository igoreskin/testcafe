# TestCafe

This is a simple illustration of an end-to-end automated test with TestCafe. To run the sample, first install TestCafe globally in your computer: 

### `npm install -g testcafe`

After that clone the repo into your computer and in the project directory run this entire command: 

### `testcafe chrome weather-widget-test.js`

TestCafe will then perform the same operations as if it was a user, i.e. it will clear the input field by clicking it, enter new data by typing it, click the Update button, and new information will then be displayed on the screen.
